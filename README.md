## Sections

* Arrays
    * Collections
    * Iteration
    * Mutation
    * Searching
    * Sets/Maps
* Asynchronous programming
    * Async await
    * Callbacks
    * Generators
    * Promises
* Functional programming
    * Declarative programming
    * Composition
    * Object oriented design
    * Recursion
    * Shared state
    * Side effects
    * Pure functions
* Weird Parts of JavaScript
  * Building a library
  * Lexical environment
  * Prototypes

## Usage

* These classes can be run in any JavaScript environment, however Node.js is a convenient tool for executing them.
* Node.js can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current).


1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidLapadula/javascript-essentials.git
cd javascript-essentials
```  
2. Open a terminal in the directory of the file you would like to execute and run the following: 
```
node <filename>
```
